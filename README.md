## 📄 This project in short
The goal of this project is to build a neural network to identify different ingredients such as lettuce, carrots or pasta. In this repository you will find the neural network and the code to control the cobot we used (uFactory xArm series 5). The cobot must be able to perform a helicoidal rotation in order to take pictures of the ingredients with a realsense camera.
The neural network will then be used with the cobot to prepare a salad.

## ✔️ Additional advices

* Do not make **passwords** and secret keys public. If you have to, replace it by a random string and a warning in the doc telling to replace it
* Avoid **long sentences**. Often, bullet points are easier to read
* **Illustrate** your reports. Use colored plots, schematics and pictures. But do not abuse of them
* Do not **duplicate** information. If it may be relevant at several places, make links
* **English** is the universal langage worldwide. Write all engineering documents in English
* Choose carefully **what sections** apply to your project and delete/add anything from the template that you think relevant
* Remove anything that would **pollute** reading, including these instructions and irrelevant sections
